32	The Lord of the Rings	J.R.R. Tolkien	Fiction	2012	A PBS Great American Read Top 100 Pick One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them In ancient times the Rings of Power were crafted by the Elven-smiths, and Sauron, the Dark Lord, forged the One Ring, filling it with his own power so that he could rule all others. But the One Ring was taken from him, and though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, it remained lost to him. After many ages it fell by chance into the hands of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins. From Sauron's fastness in the Dark Tower of Mordor, his power spread far and wide. Sauron gathered all the Great Rings to him, but always he searched for the One Ring that would complete his dominion. When Bilbo reached his eleventy-first birthday he disappeared, bequeathing to his young cousin Frodo the Ruling Ring and a perilous quest: to journey across Middle-earth, deep into the shadow of the Dark Lord, and destroy the Ring by casting it into the Cracks of Doom. The Lord of the Rings tells of the great quest undertaken by Frodo and the Fellowship of the Ring: Gandalf the Wizard; the hobbits Merry, Pippin, and Sam; Gimli the Dwarf; Legolas the Elf; Boromir of Gondor; and a tall, mysterious stranger called Strider. This new edition includes the fiftieth-anniversary fully corrected text setting and, for the first time, an extensive new index. J.R.R. Tolkien (1892-1973), beloved throughout the world as the creator of The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Silmarillion, was a professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford, a fellow of Pembroke College, and a fellow of Merton College until his retirement in 1959. His chief interest was the linguistic aspects of the early English written tradition, but while he studied classic works of the past, he was creating a set of his own.	1	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yl4dILkcqm4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	9780547951942	\N

39	The Apple Grower	Michael Phillips	Gardening	2005	For decades fruit growers have sprayed their trees with toxic chemicals in an attempt to control a range of insect and fungal pests. Yet it is possible to grow apples responsibly, by applying the intuitive knowledge of our great-grandparents with the fruits of modern scientific research and innovation. Since The Apple Grower first appeared in 1998, orchardist Michael Phillips has continued his research with apples, which have been called "organic's final frontier." In this new edition of his widely acclaimed work, Phillips delves even deeper into the mysteries of growing good fruit with minimal inputs. Some of the cuttingedge topics he explores include: The use of kaolin clay as an effective strategy against curculio and borers, as well as its limitations Creating a diverse, healthy orchard ecosystem through understory management of plants, nutrients, and beneficial microorganisms How to make a small apple business viable by focusing on heritage and regional varieties, value-added products, and the "community orchard" model The author's personal voice and clear-eyed advice have already made The Apple Grower a classic among small-scale growers and home orchardists. In fact, anyone serious about succeeding with apples needs to have this updated edition on their bookshelf.	1	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=G0Faik1mSp0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	9781603581325	\N
40	The Water Book	Alok Jha	Hydrologic cycle	2016	Water is the most every day of substances. It pours from our taps and falls from the sky. We drink it, wash with it, and couldn't live without it. Yet, on closer examination it is also a very strange substance (it is one of only a very small number of molecules which expand when cooled). Look closer again and water reveals itself as a key to a scientific story on the biggest of canvases. Water is crucial to our survival - life depends on it - but it was also fundamental in the origins of life on Earth. The millions of gallons of water which make up our rivers, lakes and oceans, originated in outer space. How it arrived here and how those molecules of water were formed, is a story which takes us back to the beginning of the universe. Indeed, we know more about the depths of space than we do about the furthest reaches of the oceans. Water has also shaped the world we live in. Whether it is by gently carving the Grand Canyon over millennia, or in shaping how civilisations were built; we have settled our cities along rivers and coasts. Scientific studies show how we feel calmer and more relaxed when next to water. We holiday by the seas and lakes. Yet one day soon wars may be fought over access to water. The Water Book will change the way you look at water. After reading it you will be able to hold a glass of water up to the light and see within it a strange molecule that connects you to the origins of life, the birth (and death) of the universe, and to everyone who ever lived.	1	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pHwcjgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api	1472209532	\N

42	Big Chicken	Maryn McKenna	Science	2017	"Americans eat chicken more than any other meat. But our nation's favorite food comes with an invisible cost: its insidious effect on our health. In this extraordinary narrative, acclaimed journalist Maryn McKenna reveals how antibiotic use has altered the way we consume industrially raised meat, and its impact on our daily lives. Drawing on decades of research, as well as interviews with entrepreneurs, epidemiologists, and other specialists, McKenna spins an astonishing story of science gone wrong. In the middle of the last century, antibiotics fueled the rapid rise of chicken from local delicacy to everyday protein source. But with that spectacular growth came great risk. As resistance to new wonder drugs crept into the farming process, bacterial outbreaks became harder to treat. And the consequences-to agriculture, to human health, and to modern medicine-were devastating. Beginning with the push to make chicken the affordable entrée of choice and tracing its evolution to a global commodity and carrier of foodborne illness, McKenna shines a light on the hidden forces of industrialization, the repercussions of runaway antibiotic use, and the outcome for future generations. Taking readers from the first poultry farms on the Delmarva Peninsula to the little-known lab where the chicken nugget was invented and into today's factory farms, McKenna reveals that the history of chicken is as much about economics, politics, and culture as it is about what we eat. In these vivid pages, she gives voice to a vanguard of farmers, chefs, and activists who are seeking to return poultry to an honored place at the table-and are changing the way we think about food. Incisive and beautifully written, Big Chicken is a cautionary tale of an industry that lost its way-and shows us the way back to healthier eating"--Back cover.	1	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6qAwDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	9781426217661	\N

51	Understanding Computers and Cognition	Terry Winograd	Computers	1986	Understanding Computers and Cognition presents an important and controversial new approach to understanding what computers do and how their functioning is related to human language, thought, and action. While it is a book about computers, Understanding Computers and Cognition goes beyond the specific issues of what computers can or can't do. It is a broad-ranging discussion exploring the background of understanding in which the discourse about computers and technology takes place. Understanding Computers and Cognition is written for a wide audience, not just those professionals involved in computer design or artificial intelligence. It represents an important contribution to the ongoing discussion about what it means to be a machine, and what it means to be human.	1	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2sRC8vcDYNEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	893910503	\N
52	The Game	Ken Dryden	Sports & Recreation	2009	Widely acknowledged as the best hockey book ever written and lauded by Sports Illustrated as one of the Top 10 Sports Books of All Time, The Game is a reflective and thought-provoking look at a life in hockey. Intelligent and insightful, former Montreal Canadiens goalie and former President of the Toronto Maple Leafs, Ken Dryden captures the essence of the sport and what it means to all hockey fans. He gives us vivid and affectionate portraits of the characters — Guy Lafleur, Larry Robinson, Guy Lapointe, Serge Savard, and coach Scotty Bowman among them — that made the Canadiens of the 1970s one of the greatest hockey teams in history. But beyond that, Dryden reflects on life on the road, in the spotlight, and on the ice, offering up a rare inside look at the game of hockey and an incredible personal memoir. This commemorative edition marks the 20th anniversary of The Game's original publication. It includes black and white photography from the Hockey Hall of Fame and a new chapter from the author. Take a journey to the heart and soul of the game with this timeless hockey classic.	1	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AzAmc5usXAEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	470739347	\N
53	Way of the Wolf	Jordan Belfort	Business & Economics	2017	"What is your number one asset in business--and in life? Persuasion: your ability to sell your product or service effectively; to close the deals, both in your business and your personal life; to stand out, be seen, and prove your case to the world; and in doing so create your greatest destiny possible all boils down to your ability to persuade. Jordan Belfort, the famous Wolf of Wall Street, cracked the code on how to persuade anyone to do anything, as well as how to teach anyone, regardless of age, education, or skill level, to be a master salesperson, closer, negotiator, entrepreneur, or speaker. Now Jordan is showing readers how to create their own circumstances to allow themselves to shape their world the way they want. You're either a victim of circumstance or you're the creator of circumstance. Key points include: cracking the code for sales and persuasion; discovering the magic bullet; creating ethical presentations that actually close the deal; mastering the art of tonality; the art and science of qualifying. Written in his own inimitable voice, this book serves as the first definitive guide on the world-famous Straight Line Sales and Persuasion System, a scientifically proven system for dramatically increasing a person's ability to influence and persuade someone for a predetermined outcome in any setting, both business and personal."--Jacket.	1	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=H4Q2DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	9781501164286	\N
54	Becoming Steve Jobs	Brent Schlender	Biography & Autobiography	2015	The #1 New York Times bestselling biography of how Steve Jobs became the most visionary CEO in history. Becoming Steve Jobs breaks down the conventional, one-dimensional view of Steve Jobs that he was half-genius, half-jerk from youth, an irascible and selfish leader who slighted friends and family alike. Becoming Steve Jobs answers the central question about the life and career of the Apple cofounder and CEO: How did a young man so reckless and arrogant that he was exiled from the company he founded become the most effective visionary business leader of our time, ultimately transforming the daily life of billions of people? Drawing on incredible and sometimes exclusive access, Schlender and Tetzeli tell a different story of a real human being who wrestled with his failings and learned to maximize his strengths over time. Their rich, compelling narrative is filled with stories never told before from the people who knew Jobs best, including his family, former inner circle executives, and top people at Apple, Pixar and Disney, most notably Tim Cook, Jony Ive, Eddy Cue, Ed Catmull, John Lasseter, Robert Iger and many others. In addition, Schlender knew Jobs personally for 25 years and draws upon his many interviews with him, on and off the record, in writing the book. He and Tetzeli humanize the man and explain, rather than simply describe, his behavior. Along the way, the book provides rich context about the technology revolution we've all lived through, and the ways in which Jobs changed our world. A rich and revealing account, Becoming Steve Jobs shows us how one of the most colorful and compelling figures of our times was able to combine his unchanging, relentless passion with an evolution in management style to create one of the most valuable and beloved companies on the planet.	1	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9ntoBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	9780385347419	\N

58	What Is Medicine?	Paul U. Unschuld	Social Science	2009	What Is Medicine? Western and Eastern Approaches to Healing is the first comparative history of two millennia of Western and Chinese medicine from their beginnings in the centuries BCE through present advances in sciences like molecular biology and in Western adaptations of traditional Chinese medicine. In his revolutionary interpretation of the basic forces that undergird shifts in medical theory, Paul U. Unschuld relates the history of medicine in both Europe and China to changes in politics, economics, and other contextual factors. Drawing on his own extended research of Chinese primary sources as well as his and others' scholarship in European medical history, Unschuld argues against any claims of "truth" in former and current, Eastern and Western models of physiology and pathology. What Is Medicine? makes an eloquent and timely contribution to discussions on health care policies while illuminating the nature of cognitive dynamics in medicine, and it stimulates fresh debate on the essence and interpretation of reality in medicine's attempts to manage the human organism.	1	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bPMTlS1pzEUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	\N	\N

This pioneering book explores treatment and counseling options, and uses real-life case histories to examine the special challenges women with AD/HD face, such as the shame of not fulfilling societal expectations. Solden explains that AD/HD affects just as many women as men, and often results in depression, disorganization, anxiety, and underachievement. Included in this revised edition is a brand new chapter on friendship challenges for women with AD/HD. Three empowering steps -- restructuring one's life, renegotiating relationships, and redefining self-image -- help women take control of their lives and enjoy success on their own terms. "Sari Solden has used her personal and professional experience to shine some light into the dark closet inhabited by far too many ADD women... She empowers ADD women by validating their experience as worthwhile human beings who struggle with serious organizational problems in many areas of their lives."

78	The Pragmatic Programmer	Andrew Hunt	Computers	1999	What others in the trenches say about The Pragmatic Programmer... “The cool thing about this book is that it’s great for keeping the programming process fresh. The book helps you to continue to grow and clearly comes from people who have been there.” —Kent Beck, author of Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change “I found this book to be a great mix of solid advice and wonderful analogies!” —Martin Fowler, author of Refactoring and UML Distilled “I would buy a copy, read it twice, then tell all my colleagues to run out and grab a copy. This is a book I would never loan because I would worry about it being lost.” —Kevin Ruland, Management Science, MSG-Logistics “The wisdom and practical experience of the authors is obvious. The topics presented are relevant and useful.... By far its greatest strength for me has been the outstanding analogies—tracer bullets, broken windows, and the fabulous helicopter-based explanation of the need for orthogonality, especially in a crisis situation. I have little doubt that this book will eventually become an excellent source of useful information for journeymen programmers and expert mentors alike.” —John Lakos, author of Large-Scale C++ Software Design “This is the sort of book I will buy a dozen copies of when it comes out so I can give it to my clients.” —Eric Vought, Software Engineer “Most modern books on software development fail to cover the basics of what makes a great software developer, instead spending their time on syntax or technology where in reality the greatest leverage possible for any software team is in having talented developers who really know their craft well. An excellent book.” —Pete McBreen, Independent Consultant “Since reading this book, I have implemented many of the practical suggestions and tips it contains. Across the board, they have saved my company time and money while helping me get my job done quicker! This should be a desktop reference for everyone who works with code for a living.” —Jared Richardson, Senior Software Developer, iRenaissance, Inc. “I would like to see this issued to every new employee at my company....” —Chris Cleeland, Senior Software Engineer, Object Computing, Inc. “If I’m putting together a project, it’s the authors of this book that I want. . . . And failing that I’d settle for people who’ve read their book.” —Ward Cunningham Straight from the programming trenches, The Pragmatic Programmer cuts through the increasing specialization and technicalities of modern software development to examine the core process--taking a requirement and producing working, maintainable code that delights its users. It covers topics ranging from personal responsibility and career development to architectural techniques for keeping your code flexible and easy to adapt and reuse.

85	Bab Edh-Dhra'	Walter E. Rast	Social Science / Archaeology	2003	<p>The important Early Bronze Age site of Bâb edh-Dhrâ', on the lisan near the Dead Sea in Jordan, was first excavated by Paul W. Lapp in the 1960s. The first volume of the Reports of the Expedition described the burial practices and artifacts revealed in the 1965-67 Bab edh-Dhra' excavations directed by Lapp. This second volume reports on the four seasons of excavation, from 1975-81, at the town site, directed by Walter E. Rast and R. Thomas Schaub. It focuses on the lifeways of the Early Bronze Age peoples who inhabited the site during the Early Bronze Age. The stratigraphy and changing architectural practices of five major phases are fully documented and interpreted, with extensive plans and sections. Alternating chapters trace the development of the ceramic sequences, accompanied by innovative statistical analyses of the wares, forms, types, and function of the town assemblage. The results of the ceramic studies are compared to the contemporary cemetery ceramic sequences and other important excavated Early Bronze Age sites such as Arad, Jericho, Ai, Megiddo, and Tel Yarmuth. A series of integrated studies based on the town site sequences focuses on the adaptive agricultural practices of the Early Bronze Age people, revealed through the paleobotanical evidence, pollen analysis, and the ground stone industry. Specialized studies on the chert tools, metals, jewelry, and glyptic art offer new insights into the cultural patterns that distinguish this period. A new series of C14 dates helps to situate the Jordanian material within the contemporary cultural sequences of the fourth and third millennia in Egypt and Mesopotamia.</p>	1	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YVkeXcHiB9IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE71OzAvtPFWPIWftqYtreA_Cppx1uhRIWaynfEtUatNJ0Ae_rIKtLtPlkdhDsEt9tQg4pgQdWkkFXuxWw7r3e6gez9btQELWk_oWK-a9DRzaBcEcGxx_7-vimDx1cqNn4fUPp1oI&source=gbs_api	9781575060880	\N

87	A School in Ren Village	Hongchang Si	Education / History	2018	By adopting oral history and fieldwork methods and exploring historical data, this book chronologically depicts the development of the schools and education in a village in North China over a century. The book reveals how education and school life in the rural village are being impacted not only by its own history and traditions, but also by external powers; more specifically, the development of rural schools is influenced by the tensions between Chinese and Western culture, between history and reality, between countryside and cities, and between national and local powers. In essence, villagers’ educational experience is actually a battlefield for school education and local tradition – the children’s lives are dominated by school education, leaving local traditions few opportunities to exert an influence. The study also discusses how school education and local traditions have influenced villagers’ social mobility, a topic that has rarely been studied in previous literature. In summary, rural schools have been developing within an interactive network composed of various actors. With the fading of national power since the 1980s, local rural actors have enjoyed a much more liberal social and political space and thus now play a more active role in rural education.<br>Presenting a microcosm that reflects the historical development of rural education in China, the book is a valuable resource for researchers in the field of in rural education, educational history, and educational anthropology, as well as for readers interested in rural education in China.	1	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_E5aDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73YOqZXxb6_re_cveUcAPFH9OHkzUD0nT4JJvlDrOwxP3uXM0QVJuAbUrIvf5xkTsscP606nidMhf_F3NdcnRtSCWtldHX-5mGNdXiBUt6wUYqeAr2qH1m4XLNwCuDMH4EdrgGp&source=gbs_api	9789811072253	\N

90	Apple Inc	Jason D. O'Grady	Business & Economics / Entrepreneurship	2009	<p>Two guys named Steve, working in a garage, created a prototype computer designed to be different in a way no one thought possible: It would be easy to use. Those two Steves, one now a billionaire and still at the head of Apple, not only succeeded with that product, but they also broke ground in the business world in ways few thought possible: They proved you could not only have fun at work, but pursuing a capitalist dream could be hip. How did Apple do it? How did it go from making computers that made a difference but not much of a dent in the overall market to creating a device (the iPod) and a music service (iTunes) that has changed the way we buy and experience music? And how did the Macintosh and its successors capture the hearts and minds of computer users so deeply that being a Mac person makes you a member of a special club? That's what this book is all about.</p><p></p><p>As author Jason D. O'Grady shows, Apple is a rare company--one that is not afraid to think about a future that does not exist and turn it into reality. Critics have written Apple off time and again, yet it rises from the ashes to astound the critics and delight its customers. That's not luck or happenstance--it's vision, dedication, and persistence. Besides delighting Apple aficionados, this book will inspire students eager to launch a business career or work in the technology sector. Apple has never been afraid to chart its own path, and readers will learn what makes the company tick.</p>	1	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BL7HpqQvU34C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE71RavaMYz9egYkaDNiKg4Cko1pMlBveIPt4DsbV7uUs45H8rxV9wPsXWBBWIbU8IRGF9SZlMEPLFguM5CE6vsT7ufyptGVefEEsXrDiFAGTcPKC2AUbuVvppZSdFZq6QK7m74bl&source=gbs_api	\N	\N
92	The Extra Yard	Mike Lupica	Juvenile Fiction / Sports & Recreation / General	2016	Teddy, a young football player, learns that sometimes bridging the distance in your family can be harder than stretching for an extra yard on the field in the second book of the Home Team series from <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author and sports-writing legend Mike Lupica.<br><br>Last spring Teddy’s life changed for the better. He started working out, shaping up, and even earned a spot on the Walton baseball team, that went all the way to the Little League World Series. But the best things to come out of that season were his friendships with Jack, Cassie, and Gus, and the confidence to finally try out for the sport he really loves—football. So when eighth grade begins, Teddy couldn’t be more psyched.<br> <br>Until his mom drops a bomb: his father—who left them a long time ago—is back in Walton and back in their lives.

At its center are the violently intertwined stories of Chilly Willy, in trouble with the law from his earliest years and now the head of the prison’s flourishing black market in drugs and sex, and of Paul, wracked with guilt for the murder of his wife and desperate for some kind of redemption. At once brutal and tender, clear-eyed and rueful, <i>On the Yard</i> presents the penitentiary not as an exotic location, an exception to everyday reality, but as an ordinary place, one every reader will recognize, American to the core.	1	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VmJ_TCTe22IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE70dlwBfghVXN3eo0yu3W5IhO7faKGUWrbTz1-CAChdQL2n3Bcv53x5I9Vdh3rSTwhQ-rYxXjmgw-a1Om7A5uplGZpwnsPs_QAw15rG58BAZpKj4d40CUBvULwglgN7iFHWxumy8&source=gbs_api	\N	\N
94	Ya/Ya	Claudia Barker	Art / American / General	1996	Young Aspirations/Young Artists (YA/YA), Inc., is the phenomenal New Orleans nonprofit arts organization started by the painter Jana Napoli in 1988. It is part school, part community center, part gallery, part working studio. But it is the commercial-art students - primarily African Americans - from nearby L. E. Rabouin Career Magnet High School in the city's central business district who breathe life into that entity. They are the YA/YAs. The YA/YAs came to the attention of the outside world through their painted chairs. Napoli first had them depict their dreams and fears on secondhand furniture and then arranged an exhibit at Lincoln Center in New York. It was a success that launched the young artists into an upward spiral of fame. In YA/YA! - a combination history, collective memoir, and guidebook - former YA/YA director Claudia Barker conveys with infectious enthusiasm the hip, happening creativity that thrives at YA/YA. She follows the trajectory of eight original YA/YAs from their early doubts and trials to their triumphal status as senior Guild members and mentors to succeeding YA/YA "generations". The group's spirit is mirrored in the book's free-form design: comments from staff and students, including deeply felt statements about their ideas and work, and scores of color photographs approximating the visual impact of the YA/YAs' art combine with Barker's own reflective narrative. By reviewing the path that YA/YA has traveled in raising funds, getting publicity, defining its purpose, and striving for harmony, she outlines a model for similar programs in other communities.	1	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Bwz8MnAk8P4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE70adsMF9_-aHIxsbQ3A6CLhn2iWN8UPJcXP1apWr6qF790HsoM_bdeNFwEdezbYbA3lARgC_wky7SXE1Pr6ugbC-NicQbKd3EnVbMDZ0_P4p_9So2cCisEquVnESibVcZd_hCp6&source=gbs_api	\N	\N
96	Symposium on Biophysics and Physiology of Biological Transport	Liana Bolis	Science / Life Sciences / Biophysics	2012	The study of cell membranes began to attract increasing interest before the turn of the present century with the observations of 0 verton. Since that time many investigators have become interested in the broad problem of structure and function of the membrane and today we find ourselVes at a stage in which several branches of research, particularly physical chemistry, biochemistry, biophysics, physiology and pharmacology have come together, leading to the possibility of obtaining a better perspective of the overall problems. The purpose of this Symposium was to assemble in an orderly sequence representations of the knowledge of membranes achieved to date in the areas of the various disciplines. It was thought that to bring together many points of view on a problem should allow the conferees to see better what had been accomplished, what has been overlooked and what needs further development. It is to be hoped that efforts of this type have and will fulfill the desired purpose. This volume contains the majority of the papers contributed by the participants in the Symposium. In addition, it seemed logical to place at the beginning of each chapter at least one general survey of the subject which would help those who were less acquainted with the problem to derive the most benefit from their reading.	1	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wmzwCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE7314inDxTKtbvGLkvclursyPdkAkI9nk0j11jAUZBkivYtdhN7EcNPHnfYNkD3JzY0cGQBRYF6hwUSMXPsMx1Wu66403FZbyBK9D17KmdtXOj3xtgmXRou7tkORDN56z-AqTvqu&source=gbs_api	\N	https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/wmzwCAAAQBAJ

97	Earth Architecture	Ronald Rael	Architecture / General	2009	Dirt—as in clay gravel sand silt soil loam mud—is everywhere and it's free. The ground we walk on and grow crops in also just happens to be the most widely used building material on the planet. <br><br>Civilizations throughout time have used it to create stable warm low-impact structures. The world's first skyscrapers were built of mud brick. Paul Revere Chairman Mao and Ronald Reagan all lived in earth houses at various points in their lives and several of the buildings housing Donald Judd's priceless collection at the Chinati Foundation in Marfa Texas are made of mud brick.<br><br>Currently it is estimated that one half of the world's population—approximately three billion people on six continents—lives or works in buildings constructed of earth. And while the vast legacy of traditional and vernacular earthen construction has been widely discussed little attention has been paid to the contemporary tradition of earth architecture. Author Ronald Rael founder of Eartharchitecture.org provides a history of building with earth in the modern era focusing particularly on projects constructed in the last few decades that use rammed earth mud brick compressed earth cob and several other interesting techniques. Earth Architecture presents a selection of more than 40 projects that exemplify new creative uses of the oldest building material on the planet.<br><br>Rael's engaging narrative addresses the misconceptions associated with earth architecture. Many assume that it's only used for housing in poor rural areas—but there are examples of airports embassies hospitals museums and factories that are made of earth. It's also assumed that earth is a fragile ephemeral material while in reality some of the oldest extant buildings on the planet are made of earth. Rael also touches on many topics that pervade both architecture and popular media today such as the ecological benefits and the politics of building with earth particularly in developing nations where earth buildings are often thought of as pre-modern or backward.

98	The Pragmatic Programmer	Andrew Hunt	Computers / Programming / General	1999	<p> <b>What others in the trenches say about <i>The Pragmatic Programmer</i>... </b> <p>“The cool thing about this book is that it’s great for keeping the programming process fresh. The book helps you to continue to grow and clearly comes from people who have been there.” </p> —<b>Kent Beck</b>, author of <i>Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change </i> <p>“I found this book to be a great mix of solid advice and wonderful analogies!” </p> —<b>Martin Fowler</b>, author of <i>Refactoring</i> and <i>UML Distilled </i> <p>“I would buy a copy, read it twice, then tell all my colleagues to run out and grab a copy. This is a book I would never loan because I would worry about it being lost.” </p> —<b>Kevin Ruland</b>, Management Science, MSG-Logistics <p>“The wisdom and practical experience of the authors is obvious. The topics presented are relevant and useful.... By far its greatest strength for me has been the outstanding analogies—tracer bullets, broken windows, and the fabulous helicopter-based explanation of the need for orthogonality, especially in a crisis situation. I have little doubt that this book will eventually become an excellent source of useful information for journeymen programmers and expert mentors alike.” </p> —<b>John Lakos</b>, author of <i>Large-Scale C++ Software Design</i> <p>“This is the sort of book I will buy a dozen copies of when it comes out so I can give it to my clients.” </p> —<b>Eric Vought</b>, Software Engineer <p>“Most modern books on software development fail to cover the basics of what makes a great software developer, instead spending their time on syntax or technology where in reality the greatest leverage possible for any software team is in having talented developers who really know their craft well. An excellent book.” </p> —<b>Pete McBreen</b>, Independent Consultant <p>“Since reading this book, I have implemented many of the practical suggestions and tips it contains. Across the board, they have saved my company time and money while helping me get my job done quicker! This should be a desktop reference for everyone who works with code for a living.” </p> —<b>Jared Richardson</b>, Senior Software Developer, iRenaissance, Inc. <p>“I would like to see this issued to every new employee at my company....” </p> —<b>Chris Cleeland</b>, Senior Software Engineer, Object Computing, Inc. <p>“If I’m putting together a project, it’s the authors of this book that I want. . . . And failing that I’d settle for people who’ve read their book.” </p> —<b>Ward Cunningham</b> <p>Straight from the programming trenches, <b> <i>The Pragmatic Programmer</i> </b> cuts through the increasing specialization and technicalities of modern software development to examine the core process--taking a requirement and producing working, maintainable code that delights its users. It covers topics ranging from personal responsibility and career development to architectural techniques for keeping your code flexible and easy to adapt and reuse. Read this book, and you'll learn how to </p> <ul> <li>Fight software rot; <li>Avoid the trap of duplicating knowledge; <li>Write flexible, dynamic, and adaptable code; <li>Avoid programming by coincidence; <li>Bullet-proof your code with contracts, assertions, and exceptions; <li>Capture real requirements; <li>Test ruthlessly and effectively; <li>Delight your users; <li>Build teams of pragmatic programmers; and <li>Make your developments more precise with automation. </li> </ul> <p>Written as a series of self-contained sections and filled with entertaining anecdotes, thoughtful examples, and interesting analogies, <b> <i>The Pragmatic Programmer</i> </b> illustrates the best practices and major pitfalls of many different aspects of software development. Whether you're a new coder, an experienced programmer, or a manager responsible for software projects, use these lessons daily, and you'll quickly see improvements in personal productivity, accuracy, and job satisfaction. You'll learn skills and develop habits and attitudes that form the foundation for long-term success in your career. You'll become a Pragmatic Programmer. </p> <br> <br> <p> </p>	10	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5wBQEp6ruIAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE70c8ngGTn74Cf6MVqKvVQP1H3Gig-rPOoUgIXxCsiB8pRZgNWj1wUBD4MMi7ZhYwmnSoexwa8cZ2-ei3KpQ-Ra7UlLpwHzlfRjyvSgguGj0019uNo5exF59s05qgMtfq-vhJDvv&source=gbs_api	\N	https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/5wBQEp6ruIAC

101	The Apple Grower	Michael Phillips	Gardening / Organic	2005	<p>For decades fruit growers have sprayed their trees with toxic chemicals in an attempt to control a range of insect and fungal pests. Yet it is possible to grow apples responsibly, by applying the intuitive knowledge of our great-grandparents with the fruits of modern scientific research and innovation.</p> <p>Since The Apple Grower first appeared in 1998, orchardist Michael Phillips has continued his research with apples, which have been called "organic's final frontier." In this new edition of his widely acclaimed work, Phillips delves even deeper into the mysteries of growing good fruit with minimal inputs. Some of the cuttingedge topics he explores include:</p> <ul> <li>The use of kaolin clay as an effective strategy against curculio and borers, as well as its limitations</li> <li>Creating a diverse, healthy orchard ecosystem through understory management of plants, nutrients, and beneficial microorganisms</li> <li>How to make a small apple business viable by focusing on heritage and regional varieties, value-added products, and the "community orchard" model</li> </ul> <p>The author's personal voice and clear-eyed advice have already made The Apple Grower a classic among small-scale growers and home orchardists. In fact, anyone serious about succeeding with apples needs to have this updated edition on their bookshelf.</p>	9	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=G0Faik1mSp0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73okM5nUZbci_PqgXRV2l8FecRE_nnWHA7JywSfL4LKpDkXYGDf0Md-GvBvi-Xq3LOvw_I-L8d8LPutWYHJGGuZOhzL4mJCxNVy9fuJZN6QIfyoxpr85pLB59at8qqyxTcRFTf7&source=gbs_api	\N	https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/G0Faik1mSp0C

111	Apple Inc	Jason D. O'Grady	Business & Economics / Entrepreneurship	2009	<p>Two guys named Steve, working in a garage, created a prototype computer designed to be different in a way no one thought possible: It would be easy to use. Those two Steves, one now a billionaire and still at the head of Apple, not only succeeded with that product, but they also broke ground in the business world in ways few thought possible: They proved you could not only have fun at work, but pursuing a capitalist dream could be hip. How did Apple do it? How did it go from making computers that made a difference but not much of a dent in the overall market to creating a device (the iPod) and a music service (iTunes) that has changed the way we buy and experience music? And how did the Macintosh and its successors capture the hearts and minds of computer users so deeply that being a Mac person makes you a member of a special club? That's what this book is all about.</p><p></p><p>As author Jason D. O'Grady shows, Apple is a rare company--one that is not afraid to think about a future that does not exist and turn it into reality. Critics have written Apple off time and again, yet it rises from the ashes to astound the critics and delight its customers. That's not luck or happenstance--it's vision, dedication, and persistence. Besides delighting Apple aficionados, this book will inspire students eager to launch a business career or work in the technology sector. Apple has never been afraid to chart its own path, and readers will learn what makes the company tick.</p>	2011	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BL7HpqQvU34C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE71b4Z5fLxQFFPs1WoFgSZ4PnqPCAXXfuAYmZTXt8Xcn2dGL_qOFheoXjCWEboNJFtnL2Ea_8Yq0vgOIZYAdfWKAEnZgNrqXqkD_iByQiojbRB2SkSwvRcJ3XwQht78Cb2wLSDtE&source=gbs_api	\N	https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/BL7HpqQvU34C

119	On the Yard	Malcolm Braly	Fiction / Crime	2012	A major American novel, and arguably the finest work of literature ever to emerge from a US prison, <i>On the Yard</i> is a book of penetrating psychological realism in which Malcolm Braly paints an unforgettable picture of the complex and frightening world of the penitentiary. At its center are the violently intertwined stories of Chilly Willy, in trouble with the law from his earliest years and now the head of the prison’s flourishing black market in drugs and sex, and of Paul, wracked with guilt for the murder of his wife and desperate for some kind of redemption. At once brutal and tender, clear-eyed and rueful, <i>On the Yard</i> presents the penitentiary not as an exotic location, an exception to everyday reality, but as an ordinary place, one every reader will recognize, American to the core.	0	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VmJ_TCTe22IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE70dlwBfghVXN3eo0yu3W5IhO7faKGUWrbTz1-CAChdQL2n3Bcv53x5I9Vdh3rSTwhQ-rYxXjmgw-a1Om7A5uplGZpwnsPs_QAw15rG58BAZpKj4d40CUBvULwglgN7iFHWxumy8&source=gbs_api	\N	\N
181	On the Clock	Emily Guendelsberger	Social Science / Poverty & Homelessness	2019	<b>"<i>Nickel and Dimed </i>for the Amazon age," (Salon) the bitingly funny, eye-opening story of finding work in the automated and time-starved world of hourly low-wage labor</b><br>After the local newspaper where she worked as a reporter closed, Emily Guendelsberger took a pre-Christmas job at an Amazon fulfillment center outside Louisville, Kentucky. There, the vending machines were stocked with painkillers, and the staff turnover was dizzying. In the new year, she travelled to North Carolina to work at a call center, a place where even bathroom breaks were timed to the second. And finally, Guendelsberger was hired at a San Francisco McDonald's, narrowly escaping revenge-seeking customers who pelted her with condiments.<br><br>Across three jobs, and in three different parts of the country, Guendelsberger directly took part in the revolution changing the U.S. workplace. Offering an up-close portrait of America's actual "essential workers," <i>On the Clock</i> examines the broken social safety net as well as an economy that has purposely had all the slack drained out and converted to profit. Until robots pack boxes, resolve billing issues, and make fast food, human beings supervised by AI will continue to get the job done. Guendelsberger shows us how workers went from being the most expensive element of production to the cheapest - and how low wage jobs have been remade to serve the ideals of efficiency, at the cost of humanity.<br><br><i>On the Clock</i> explores the lengths that half of Americans will go to in order to make a living, offering not only a better understanding of the modern workplace, but also surprising solutions to make work more humane for millions of Americans.	0	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qnB2DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE70JGhJdWIzM4jox9Sg_Oa-isfSR3IogXwBbu3TSO_Qd60cLrX34CbvvPf8ne75ALu9XShuNryi_HRZkp23-8SPhlv3folrBsSXx3hKlkkczpa-rQjJFTiarkTILcSovlY2OAXK5&source=gbs_api	\N	https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/qnB2DwAAQBAJ

134	Alluvial Fans	Adrian M. Harvey	Science / Earth Sciences / General	2005	Alluvial fans are important sedimentary environments. They trap sediment delivered from mountain source areas, and exert an important control on the delivery of sediment to downstream environments, to axial drainages and to sedimentary basins. They preserve a sensitive record of environmental change within the mountain source areas. Alluvial fan geomorphology and sedimentology reflect not only drainage basin size and geology, but change in response to tectonic, climatic and base-level controls. One of the challenges facing alluvial fan research is to resolve how these gross controls are reflected in alluvial fan dynamics and to apply the results of studies of modern fan processes and Quaternary fans to the understanding of sedimentary sequences in the rock record. This volume includes papers based on up-to-date research, and focuses on three themes: alluvial fan processes, dynamics of Quaternary alluvial fans and fan sedimentary sequences. Linking the papers is an emphasis on the controls of fan geomorphology, sedimentology and dynamics. This provides a basis for integration between geomorphological and sedimentological approaches, and an understanding how fluvial systems respond to tectonic, climatic and base-level changes.	1	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1I0DxIufQgIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE70YyAzwr7f3lFxB95RaWZG85iMR0MidWyllu7V6Jgy-dsg7sbNZ7jwtOFqLuXd1V6bKDUjQIXBFpUsCfhZcmM8VnbGc5jRm1K9yBuRZIxH00XX27k2b_2qs2BywmaQrkHVsSnOO&source=gbs_api	\N	https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/1I0DxIufQgIC

131	Edward Yang	John Anderson	Performing Arts / Film / History & Criticism	2005	Having largely given up on a career in film, Edward Yang had been working as a computer engineer for several years when he saw Herzog's Aguirre, Wrath of God. Inspired to return to film, Yang, along with a handful of other filmmakers including the great Hou Hsiao_hsien, went on to found the Taiwanese New Wave of the early 1980s. Film critic John Anderson's Edward Yang offers a comprehensive overview of the work of the writer-director--already considered one of the most important filmmakers of the past twenty years--from his breakthrough feature That Day, on the Beach to the epic Yi-Yi. Rooted in questions about what it means to be Taiwanese, Yang's films reveal the complexity of life within the island's patchwork culture. Anderson identifies the key narrative strategies, formal devices, moral vision, and sociopolitical concerns shot through Yang's films. He explains what makes these films so distinctive by pinpointing the specific qualities of Yang's style and outlook. John Anderson is the chief film critic for Newsday. He also writes for the Los Angeles Times, L.A. Weekly, Film Comment, Billboard, Washington Post, The Nation, and more. America's Most Important Film Festival.

At the heart of this story is a question with no simple answer: has the extraordinary commercializing and branding of NFL football since the late 1980s ironically weakened the cultural power of a sport whose appeal for more than a century was fundamentally noncommercial?	1	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jWCo55YrBtIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE711P2FCk9HEekV9uHTg-ISV-s1j_FwM1KNA5iTdOHtEdsKt1jIikRQ-tck87uIpia7hXUDCYSJso9jeFstJhDzfsdi0ceobw2OMoK9uRt1SClHLuVjxWBCgDx_SQ_ywFO1dQKPN&source=gbs_api	\N	https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/jWCo55YrBtIC

150	For Space	Doreen Massey	Science / Earth Sciences / Geography	2005	"The reason for my enthusiasm for this book is that Doreen Massey manages to describe a certain way of perceiving movement in space which I have been - and still am - working with on different levels in my work: i.e. the idea that space is not something static and neutral, a frozen entity, but is something intertwined with time and thus ever changing - also when we are not occupying it. Doreen's descriptions of her journey through England for example are clear and precise accounts of this idea, and she very sharply characterizes the attempts not to recognize this idea as utopian and nostalgic." <br>- Olafur Eliasson <p></p><p></p><p>In this book, Doreen Massey makes an impassioned argument for revitalising our imagination of space. She takes on some well-established assumptions from philosophy, and some familiar ways of characterising the twenty-first century world, and shows how they restrain our understanding of both the challenge and the potential of space.</p><p></p><p>The way we think about space matters. It inflects our understandings of the world, our attitudes to others, our politics. It affects, for instance, the way we understand globalisation, the way we approach cities, the way we develop, and practice, a sense of place. If time is the dimension of change then space is the dimension of the social: the contemporaneous co-existence of others. That is its challenge, and one that has been persistently evaded. <b>For Space</b> pursues its argument through philosophical and theoretical engagement, and through telling personal and political reflection. Doreen Massey asks questions such as how best to characterise these so-called spatial times, how it is that implicit spatial assumptions inflect our politics, and how we might develop a responsibility for place beyond place.</p><p></p><p>This book is "for space" in that it argues for a reinvigoration of the spatiality of our implicit cosmologies. <b>For Space </b>is essential reading for anyone interested in space and the spatial turn in the social sciences and humanities. Serious, and sometimes irreverent, it is a compelling manifesto: for re-imagining spaces for these times and facing up to their challenge.</p>	1	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xgrVr6Y_3ZcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE70UO43wUO3pDoP5O_ZwyFhxgHvRR9aw6Iz030E1KOFyiLB7jP1p6-QqJNf9kC2ghX8GFAQy1zZ3CxO_7mzpLNPoSCoEY_QnqAZOO9OnQXwxJyrVIIuVazW50oCqhg_D84wdvtxX&source=gbs_api	\N	https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/xgrVr6Y_3ZcC

154	What Schools Ban and why	Robert Murray Thomas	Education / General	2008	<p>Schools in the United States have historically banned many different things. From clothing to weapons, from cell phones to books, schools have implemented various types of censorship and restrictions on their students for a variety of reasons and with a variety of results. This book's purpose is to describe the various things banned in schools, the reasons behind attempts to ban such things, the types of people who approve of censoring those things and the types who do not, the outcome of representative cases of censorship, and suggestions for school personnel about how to cope with bans. Each chapter addresses the same sequence of topics: a particular type of ban's domain and historical background; representative cases of the ban's application; ban supporters and their methods; ban critics and their methods; and ways of resolving conflicts over the ban.</p><p></p><p>While some may argue that cell phones are necessary in today's school setting, others would suggest they are disruptive. While some may argue <i>The Catcher in the Rye</i> should be banned, others may say it is essential reading for American students. More recently, some schools have banned all of the Harry Potter books from their library shelves. Few would argue that a ban on weapons is a bad thing, but who determines what should be considered a weapon? In some schools, restrictions are placed on Web access, but who decides what to allow and what not to allow? Where do the lines get drawn? Here, Thomas reviews the many areas of censorship in our schools and helps readers draw their own conclusions.</p>	1	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Eu1_ZTMaggYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE72gaiep8bqps1SlrQRcuvFQS7S7J8QR3Rq_vYHl_9MBUFVTkTD2HUUusBxZlhJtnUz-emUTA-tdTA8FTadixG41Ek4mAPUYAwZR9MihS4734coP6oP20mxtUsOJrow3igvTrd1M&source=gbs_api	\N	https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Eu1_ZTMaggYC

The mission, says Darrell Guder in this book, is to complete the work of salvation that God began in the incarnation of his son Jesus Christ. The message is the gospel -- the good news of the incarnate Christ. And the messengers are the Body of Christ -- the church -- who have been called to be his witnesses. Only as we understand Christ's incarnation and the church's role in proclaiming its meaning, according to Guder, can we understand our calling to be witnesses of God's salvation.	0	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=T8ULcMlfyO4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE72EH1kl-BSa3INYuU4P_uOub1GYIIgUYuGh4DcJ76d_HBj_J6cgLVD5HQQbUSUIhbCKtB3VfFdDt-PFsFDjurxYdclPxvGqKUsYKPbuwzP-nQEH-pqJ_ccjagtxaoJ8XSktuGSP&source=gbs_api	\N	https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/T8ULcMlfyO4C

155	On the Yard	Malcolm Braly	Fiction / Crime	2012	A major American novel, and arguably the finest work of literature ever to emerge from a US prison, <i>On the Yard</i> is a book of penetrating psychological realism in which Malcolm Braly paints an unforgettable picture of the complex and frightening world of the penitentiary. At its center are the violently intertwined stories of Chilly Willy, in trouble with the law from his earliest years and now the head of the prison’s flourishing black market in drugs and sex, and of Paul, wracked with guilt for the murder of his wife and desperate for some kind of redemption. At once brutal and tender, clear-eyed and rueful, <i>On the Yard</i> presents the penitentiary not as an exotic location, an exception to everyday reality, but as an ordinary place, one every reader will recognize, American to the core.	1	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VmJ_TCTe22IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE70dlwBfghVXN3eo0yu3W5IhO7faKGUWrbTz1-CAChdQL2n3Bcv53x5I9Vdh3rSTwhQ-rYxXjmgw-a1Om7A5uplGZpwnsPs_QAw15rG58BAZpKj4d40CUBvULwglgN7iFHWxumy8&source=gbs_api	\N	\N

130	Extra Yarn	Mac Barnett	No genre listed	2014	This is an extraordinary new picture book about a little girl who cocoons her cold, grey town in joy and warmth ... and brightly coloured yarn! On a cold, dark day in a dull, grey town, little Annabelle discovers a box of brightly coloured yarn. She knits a cosy jumper to keep herself nice and toasty warm and finds, to her surprise, that she still has yarn left over. So she decides to knit her dog a jumper too but - hang on a second - she STILL has extra yarn! Annabelle knits and knits and, soon, she's blanketed the entire town in a rainbow of colour, knitting away the dreary iciness that grips it. Her prodigious status spreads far and wide. It doesn't take long for the evil Archduke to set his beady eyes upon Annabelle's magical box of yarn but, little does he know, you have to have a little bit of magic inside your heart for it to work ...

136	How Can I Help?	Ram Dass	Self-Help / Affirmations	2011	Not a day goes by without our being called upon to help one another--at home, at work, on the street, on the phone. . . . We do what we can. Yet so much comes up to complicate this natural response: "Will I have what it takes?" "How much is enough?" "How can I deal with suffering?" "And what really helps, anyway?"<br><br>In this practical helper's companion, the authors explore a path through these confusions, and provide support and inspiration fo us in our efforts as members of the helping professions, as volunteers, as community activists, or simply as friends and family trying to meet each other's needs. Here too are deeply moving personal accounts: A housewife brings zoo animals to lift the spirits of nursing home residents; a nun tends the wounded on the first night of the Nicaraguan revolution; a police officer talks a desperate father out of leaping from a roof with his child; a nurse allows an infant to spend its last moments of life in her arms rather than on a hospital machine. From many such stories and the authors' reflections, we can find strength, clarity, and wisdom for those times when we are called on to care for one another. <b>How Can I Help?</b> reminds us just how much we have to give and how doing so can lead to some of the most joyous moments of our lives.	0	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lG-hcurmlZIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE72lF7-SYIpl0eO-oCFvAucGPfQza2cRu2eG2nx4vZhhCAVIlsgAVpw1glky1aNbunsAPIy22dpLFOoLkGVikciLC6LZmu0VaUmnKSsXgOG_Hu7e8QF_97dbkg6JnpLtFmYFcBOi&source=gbs_api	\N	https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/lG-hcurmlZIC

159	Happy for No Reason	Marci Shimoff	Self-Help / Personal Growth / Happiness	2008	<b>What would it take to make you happy? A fulfilling career, a big bank account, or the perfect mate? What if it didn't take anything to make you happy? What if you could experience happiness from the inside out -- no matter what's going on in your life?</b> <br> <br> In <i>Happy for No Reason: 7 Steps to Being Happy from the Inside Out,</i> transformational expert Marci Shimoff offers a breakthrough approach to being happy, one that doesn't depend on achievements, goals, money, relationships, or anything else "out there." Most books on happiness tell you to find the things that make you happy and do more of them. Although there's nothing wrong with that, it won't bring you the kind of deep and lasting happiness most people long for -- the kind you'll never lose, no matter what happens in your life. Based on cutting-edge research and knowledge from the world's leading experts in the fields of positive psychology and neurophysiology, plus interviews with 100 truly happy people, this life-changing book provides a powerful, proven 7-step program that will enable you to be happier right now -- no matter where you start. <br> <br> Studies show that each of us has a "happiness setpoint" -- a fixed range of happiness we tend to return to throughout our life -- that's approximately 50 percent genetic and 50 percent learned. In the same way you'd crank up the thermostat to get comfortable on a chilly day, you can actually raise your happiness set-point! The holistic 7-step program at the heart of <i>Happy for No Reason</i> encompasses Happiness Habits for all areas of life: personal power, mind, heart, body, soul, purpose, and relationships. <br> <br> In these pages you'll discover moving and remarkable first-person stories of people who have applied these steps to their own lives and have become Happy for No Reason. You'll read phenomenal tales from a former drug dealer turned minister, a hit filmmaker, and a famous actress who escaped a "family curse," as well as stories from doctors, mothers, teachers, and business executives. You'll learn practical strategies that will help you experience happiness from the inside out. <br> <br> You don't have to have happy genes, win the lottery, or lose twenty pounds. By the time you finish this book, you will know how to experience sustained happiness for the rest of your life.	1	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oWrKL3JNXKsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE70uFGcng7w4rt9tLfgKPDoVWOebvcHi7Z9cz1PscE7AJyQ2VYzOCpTjeTMmRskyf9RJX9GKfyL-MEajI-IiNMgoU34MCRT1Uq7Wv3xK8YrVByZrw017wat4osND0ZZ9Y5DqNFzk&source=gbs_api	\N	https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/oWrKL3JNXKsC

165	Value Chain Management in the Chemical Industry	Matthias Kannegiesser	Business & Economics / Strategic Planning	2008	<p>Supply chain management helped companies to manage volumes, fulfil customer demand and optimize costs in production and distribution. Specifically, chemical industry companies with high complexity in production and distribution used supply chain management to steer their operations. Confronted with globalization and increasing raw material and sales price volatility, optimizing supply chain costs is no longer sufficient to ensure the overall profitability of the business. Value chain management takes supply chain management to the next level by integrating all volume and value decisions from sales to procurement. The book presents the value chain management concept and demonstrates how it is applied in a global value chain planning model for commodities in the chemical industry. A comprehensive industry case study illustrates the effects of decision making integration, e.g. the influence of raw material prices or exchange rates on optimal sales, production, distribution and procurement plans as well as overall company profitability.</p>	1	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=F2oaGQllNnwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73ONSG1WOuE6Lai59q64FoeQW5o10I31G-ldGiST1Ou2DvU5VoyObHwH_RPYWi7tXz5Cg_P6Oz-gQPhYgZwQGASWIHX-y-36yZbUQZIX9pbY6vU3FRKQJ5pOYLFpYKy2aNo1JaI&source=gbs_api	\N	https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/F2oaGQllNnwC

170	Mark Z. Danielewski's House of Leaves	Mark Z. Danielewski	Fiction / Horror	2000	Years ago, when <b>House of Leaves</b> was first being passed around, it was nothing more than a badly bundled heap of paper, parts of which would occasionally surface on the Internet. No one could have anticipated the small but devoted following this terrifying story would soon command. Starting with an odd assortment of marginalized youth -- musicians, tattoo artists, programmers, strippers, environmentalists, and adrenaline junkies -- the book eventually made its way into the hands of older generations, who not only found themselves in those strangely arranged pages but also discovered a way back into the lives of their estranged children.<br> <br> Now, for the first time, this astonishing novel is made available in book form, complete with the original colored words, vertical footnotes, and newly added second and third appendices.<br> <br> The story remains unchanged, focusing on a young family that moves into a small home on Ash Tree Lane where they discover something is terribly wrong: their house is bigger on the inside than it is on the outside.<br> <br> Of course, neither Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist Will Navidson nor his companion Karen Green was prepared to face the consequences of that impossibility, until the day their two little children wandered off and their voices eerily began to return another story -- of creature darkness, of an ever-growing abyss behind a closet door, and of that unholy growl which soon enough would tear through their walls and consume all their dreams.	1	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qGA_3RGqTkQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73D-gtGG2N2IhP33ofjtyO4pZkvtOr2Gy163aLQN1z6JVIE4JKbETPk8kAPcUysGhzAvfYL0lRg9KWCQIiaxNkhtKc1k8LpVUPKJaYx_enn8oOmFs9TXY7GDjBDm1QffzTbuteS&source=gbs_api	\N	https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/qGA_3RGqTkQC
171	Ken Follett	Carlos Ramet	Social Science / Popular Culture	1999	Carlos Ramet focuses on the artistic development and cultural implications of the best-selling author of works such as <i>Eye of the Needle</i> (1978), <i>The Pillars of the Earth</i> (1989), and <i>The Hammer of Eden</i> (1998). Beginning with his earliest published novel, <i>The Big Needle</i> (1974), Ramet explores the tension between the popular and the serious that has underlain much of Follett's work. Ramet examines this writer's blending of genres, film adaptations of his novels, and his keen ability to extend his readership through a “hybridization” process. Ramet linguistically analyzes Follett's flexibility with literary forms; explores archetypal patterns; and demonstrates that Follett's involvement in British politics is reflected not only in his latest works but has been implied by his novels from the start.	1	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xkGlUNW09eEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE70B3a32VE71u5zZADdr4OdpqtNijOlqfbXJfepTO04Z3ITEeY08Mz7Po5rD64-i2i4rLjc7DSeGoX4c1qeTTm13jSEh0OY6TeaQX_9THnBk56DhxAWqXMlxqLA7HrCCu6UvO36P&source=gbs_api	\N	https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/xkGlUNW09eEC

Traditional Barn Dances With Calls & Fiddling contains these items:</p> <p>- An easy-to-use book that features the calls and directions for the dances in large print so you can read them from a distance as you move about the room to help dancers</p> <p>- Sheet music for the fiddle tunes to promote interdisciplinary collaborations with general music teachers, orchestra directors, and string teachers and to encourage the use of live music with the dancing</p> <p>- Folklore, facts, and teaching suggestions for each dance</p> <p>- A DVD that includes a video glossary showing the moves as well as walk-throughs and full demonstrations for selected dances</p> <p>- Two CDs of authentic fiddle tunes for many of the dances with the calls on one track followed by the music track without calls</p> <p><i>Traditional Barn Dances With Calls & Fiddling</i> is much more than just dance steps. Lovers of both music and folk culture will enjoy the beautiful cadence and lilt in Dudley Laufman''s voice as he calls over the music. The calls blend with the music recorded by traditional dance fiddlers and other musicians on piano, accordion, harmonica, and limberjack, which allow a one-of-a-kind experience in an era when most people will never get to experience a real barn dance, an important part of American cultural history.</p> <p>This comprehensive package provides the tools for facilitating an interdisciplinary learning experience as participants learn the dances along with their historical contexts. Participants also have the option of playing the music themselves, using the sheet music, or selecting from the music CD tracks. Over time, you will learn the calls, and you can call the dances yourself.</p> <p>After presenting background on traditional barn dancing and instructions on setting up and calling dances, the Laufmans organize the dances according to three traditional formations, providing detailed instruction on circle dances, square dances, and longways dances. They also cover dances in other formations and provide suggestions for including people in wheelchairs and those with varying abilities.</p> <p><i>Traditional Barn Dances With Calls & Fiddling</i> also presents teaching tips and tools, including historical tidbits, a glossary, poems and word search puzzles, as well as an index of dances by various categories, such as formation, difficulty, title, and music track. At the end of the book, they explain how to organize a dance to promote social dancing, music appreciation, and community.</p> <p>Social folk dancing has withstood the test of time because it appeals to people''s sense of and desire for community while dancing to joyful music. <i>Traditional Barn Dances With Calls & Fiddling</i> will help you build community--and skills--within your group. All will have a great time while taking part in an ongoing tradition of this resounding music and joyful dancing.<br></p>	1	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tlzbrwt0Qa0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE71OhQvKVaNQHl7eXdGmClDZNd4xzWrEXYz4nCgkXCw1D8qMs8ZNPm8xx7xhwkBrT0vMtL579dqru16yKP6o-aFD0bgQCTCV4B__shucE3zL60MYyoEZuo48hScbV6_330Nhc7Nf&source=gbs_api	\N	https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/tlzbrwt0Qa0C

180	Bam!	J. E. Wallace, Jr.	Religion / General	2009	Some suggest that it will take a miracle for this nation to rebound and recover from the brink of economic and environmental ruins it appears to be standing upon at this time. We all (as one nation under God) can look forward, someday soon, to saying, "BAM!" (meaning it must be a miracle) if we keep a fresh perspective and a firm belief in the power of God to help us overcome our every obstacle. It is through this great spirit of optimism that this nation has become, and shall continue to be, a great nation. This literary work serves as a guidebook towards positive thinking, perfect timing and placing in God our utmost trust. It translates our everyday experiences of trial and error into innovative ideas towards new learning. The contents within these chapters serve also as models, paradigms, examples and illustrations designed to help individuals in their daily walk with God.	1	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HEXaOg_kwfQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE721wfbspYmlTLJHOfdGI1gAqowjH3MnzB6gAuMn2FlM0LQ5C2eJq5efyHpnPUQLg52vQGPmGHxl7LwP9X9WxDQ4A5yFGdOXuivAUbGkyGCT0ni2vg1EANXBFEs41TALfWFVgnCO&source=gbs_api	\N	https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/HEXaOg_kwfQC

137	Yarn Harlot	Stephanie Pearl-McPhee	Crafts & Hobbies / Needlework / Knitting	2009	<p>Stephanie Pearl-McPhee's deepest wish is that everyone understand that knitting is at least as fun as baseball and way cooler than the evil looped path of crochet. Every project, from a misshapen hat to the most magnificent sweater, holds a story. <i>Yarn Harlot</i> tells all those stories with humor, insight, and sympathy for the obsessed.</p><p>Over 50 million people in America knit. The average knitter spends between $500 and $1,700 a year on yarn, patterns, needles, and books. No longer just a fad or a hobby, knitting has advanced to a lifestyle.</p><p><i>Yarn Harlot: The Secret Life of a Knitter</i> moves beyond instructions and patterns into the purest elements of knitting: obsession, frustration, reflection, and fun. Stephanie Pearl-McPhee's humorous and poignant essays find humor in knitting an enormous afghan that requires a whopping 30 balls of wool, having a husband with size 13 feet who loves to wear hand-knit socks, and earns her "yarn harlot" title with her love of any new yarn--she'll quickly drop an old project for the fresh saucy look of a new interesting yarn.</p><p>Since the upsurge in knitting began in the early '90s, the number of women under 45 who knit has doubled. Knitting is no longer a hobby for just grandmothers--women and men of all ages are embracing this art. Describing its allure is best left to Stephanie who explains: "It is a well-known fact that knitting is a sparkling form of entertainment, as spiritual as yoga, as relaxing as a massage, and as funny as Erma Bombeck trapped in a PTA meeting."</p>	0	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=34QNnUiM0kAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE72t-KQ0JDiwCyoutvToB5S_v6ZJDNYbFaZOhO6BgShUlnVV3zGNpgXzVxQFm9Ypyp8rbMimPuGgjBWn2-YN3DPX0FopWg-hs83jGtz_HmqFFJxOum9-CNBdg-eas8IzaMldCGzt&source=gbs_api	\N	https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/34QNnUiM0kAC
